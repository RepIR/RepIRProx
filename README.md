RepIRProx
=========

Master pom for RepIR RepIRTools RepIRApps and RepIRProximity, to reproduce the results for "Distance Matters!"

To compile the project, you either need this master pom, or you have to modify the pom's for the indiviual libs. The master pom handles the hadoop version used, and uploading the jars to the server (if you need that).
